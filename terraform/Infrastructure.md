### Summary of Cloud Infrastructure Requirements for Target Project

Based on the analysis of the provided files and the target project description, the infrastructure requirements for migrating the existing Azure-based data warehousing and analytics solution to Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using Terraform are outlined below. The goal is to replicate the functionality of the Azure-based architecture using equivalent GCP services while adhering to the principles of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and leveraging Terraform for deployment and management.

### Required Infrastructure Components

#### 1. **Data Sources**
   - **On-Premises Databases**:
     - Equivalent to SQL Server and Oracle on-premises.
     - Use **Cloud VPN** or **Cloud Interconnect** to securely connect on-premises databases to GCP.
   - **Cloud Databases**:
     - Equivalent to Azure SQL Database.
     - Use **Cloud SQL** (PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQL Server) for managed relational databases.
   - **NoSQL Databases**:
     - Equivalent to Azure Table Storage and Azure Cosmos DB.
     - Use **Cloud Bigtable** for wide-column NoSQL storage and **Firestore** for document-based NoSQL storage.

#### 2. **Data Lake Storage**
   - Equivalent to Azure Data Lake Storage.
   - Use **Cloud Storage** (with appropriate bucket configurations) to stage and store raw data from various sources.

#### 3. **Data Orchestration**
   - Equivalent to Azure Data Factory.
   - Use **Cloud Dataflow** for data transformation and orchestration.
   - Alternatively, use **Workflows** or **Apache Airflow** (via **Cloud Composer**) for orchestration pipelines.

#### 4. **Data Warehouse**
   - Equivalent to Azure Synapse Analytics.
   - Use **BigQuery** for a fully managed, serverless data warehouse with massive parallel processing (MPP) capabilities.
   - Use **BigQuery Data Transfer Service** for loading data from Cloud Storage or other sources.

#### 5. **Data Analysis**
   - Equivalent to Azure Analysis Services.
   - Use **Looker** or **BigQuery BI Engine** for semantic modeling and enhanced performance during data analysis.
   - Alternatively, use **Connected Sheets** for lightweight analysis directly on BigQuery.

#### 6. **Data Visualization**
   - Equivalent to Microsoft Power BI.
   - Use **Looker Studio** (formerly Data Studio) for business intelligence and data visualization.

#### 7. **Authentication and Access Management**
   - Equivalent to Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD).
   - Use **Google Cloud Identity** and **IAM (Identity and Access Management)** for authentication, role-based access control, and resource permissions.

#### 8. **Networking**
   - Secure data flow between components:
     - Use **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)** for network isolation.
     - Use **Private Google Access** to ensure secure communication between GCP services.
     - Use **Cloud NAT** for outbound internet access where required.

#### 9. **Monitoring and Logging**
   - Equivalent to Azure Monitor.
   - Use **Cloud Monitoring** and **Cloud Logging** for observability, performance monitoring, and centralized logging.

#### 10. **Security**
   - Data encryption:
     - Use **Cloud Key Management Service (KMS)** for managing encryption keys.
   - Secure data in transit:
     - Use **TLS/SSL** for secure communication between services.

#### 11. **Terraform Configuration**
   - Use Terraform to define and manage the infrastructure:
     - Specify the `google` provider with version `~> 4.0`.
     - Enforce a minimum Terraform version of `>= 1.3.0`.
   - Modularize Terraform configurations for scalability and reusability.

### Comprehensive Infrastructure Requirements Document

#### **1. Overview**
The infrastructure will replicate the functionality of the Azure-based data warehousing and analytics solution on GCP. It will handle data ingestion, transformation, storage, analysis, and visualization using GCP services. Terraform will be used to define, provision, and manage the infrastructure in a consistent and repeatable manner.

#### **2. Infrastructure Components**
1. **Data Sources**:
   - On-premises databases connected via **Cloud VPN** or **Cloud Interconnect**.
   - Cloud databases using **Cloud SQL**.
   - NoSQL databases using **Cloud Bigtable** and **Firestore**.

2. **Data Lake Storage**:
   - Use **Cloud Storage** buckets for staging and storing raw data.

3. **Data Orchestration**:
   - Use **Cloud Dataflow** or **Cloud Composer** for data transformation and orchestration.

4. **Data Warehouse**:
   - Use **BigQuery** for data warehousing and analytics.

5. **Data Analysis**:
   - Use **Looker** or **BigQuery BI Engine** for semantic modeling and analysis.

6. **Data Visualization**:
   - Use **Looker Studio** for business intelligence and visualization.

7. **Authentication and Access Management**:
   - Use **Google Cloud Identity** and **IAM** for authentication and access control.

8. **Networking**:
   - Use **VPC**, **Private Google Access**, and **Cloud NAT** for secure networking.

9. **Monitoring and Logging**:
   - Use **Cloud Monitoring** and **Cloud Logging** for observability.

10. **Security**:
    - Use **Cloud KMS** for encryption key management.
    - Use **TLS/SSL** for secure communication.

11. **Terraform Configuration**:
    - Use Terraform with the `google` provider (`~> 4.0`) and enforce a minimum Terraform version (`>= 1.3.0`).
    - Modularize configurations for scalability.

#### **3. Key Considerations**
- Ensure data compliance and security by encrypting data at rest and in transit.
- Optimize costs by selecting appropriate GCP service tiers and configurations.
- Design for scalability to handle growing data volumes and user demands.
- Implement disaster recovery and backup strategies using GCP's multi-region capabilities.

#### **4. Deliverables**
- Terraform configuration files (`main.tf`, modules, variables, outputs).
- Documentation for deploying and managing the infrastructure.
- Monitoring and alerting setup for operational visibility.
