### Summary of Cloud Infrastructure Requirements for Target Project

Based on the analysis of the provided files and the target project description, the infrastructure requirements for migrating the existing Azure-based data warehousing and analytics solution to Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using Terraform are outlined below. The goal is to replicate the functionality of the Azure-based architecture using equivalent GCP services while adhering to the principles of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and leveraging Terraform for deployment and management.

### Required Infrastructure Components

#### 1. **Data Sources**
   - Equivalent GCP services to handle data ingestion from various sources:
     - **Cloud SQL**: For relational databases (e.g., SQL Server and Oracle equivalents).
     - **BigQuery**: For structured data storage and analysis.
     - **Cloud Storage**: For unstructured data staging (equivalent to Azure Data Lake Storage).
     - **Firestore**: For NoSQL database needs (equivalent to Azure Cosmos DB).

#### 2. **Data Staging and Orchestration**
   - **Cloud Storage**: To stage source data before processing (equivalent to Azure Data Lake Storage).
   - **Dataflow**: For orchestrating data movement and transformation (equivalent to Azure Data Factory).
     - Supports parallel processing for large datasets, similar to PolyBase.

#### 3. **Data Warehousing**
   - **BigQuery**: As the central data warehouse (equivalent to Azure Synapse Analytics).
     - Provides massive parallel processing (MPP) for high-performance analytics.
     - Supports integration with Cloud Storage for rapid data ingestion.

#### 4. **Data Analysis**
   - **Looker**: For semantic modeling and data analysis (equivalent to Azure Analysis Services).
     - Provides a semantic layer for business data relationships and analysis.

#### 5. **Visualization**
   - **Looker Studio** (or **Google Data Studio**): For business analytics and visualization (equivalent to Microsoft Power BI).
     - Enables querying of semantic models or direct querying of BigQuery.

#### 6. **Authentication and Access Management**
   - **Google Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM)**: For managing authentication and access control (equivalent to Microsoft Entra ID).

#### 7. **Networking and Security**
   - **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)**: For secure networking and connectivity.
   - **Cloud Interconnect**: For hybrid connectivity with on-premises systems (if required).
   - **Cloud NAT**: For managing outbound internet traffic securely.

#### 8. **Monitoring and Logging**
   - **Cloud Monitoring**: For infrastructure and application performance monitoring.
   - **Cloud Logging**: For centralized log management.

#### 9. **Terraform Configuration**
   - **Terraform**: Version `>= 1.3.0`.
   - **Google Provider for Terraform**: Version `~> 4.0`.
   - Modular design to ensure scalability and extensibility.
