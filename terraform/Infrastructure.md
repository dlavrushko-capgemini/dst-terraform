### Summary of Cloud Infrastructure Requirements

Based on the analysis of the provided files, the project requires a cloud infrastructure that supports a highly available MySQL cluster with monitoring and visualization tools. The infrastructure must ensure redundancy, fault tolerance, scalability, and efficient traffic management. Below is a summary of the required infrastructure components:

1. **Compute Instances**:
   - Instances for MySQL Source and Replica nodes.
   - Instances for ProxySQL for query routing and load balancing.
   - Instances for Orchestrator to manage MySQL replication topology.
   - Dedicated instances for monitoring tools (Prometheus) and visualization tools (Grafana).

2. **Networking**:
   - Internal Load Balancer to distribute traffic across ProxySQL instances.
   - Network configurations to enable communication between components (e.g., Source, Replica, ProxySQL, Orchestrator).

3. **Storage**:
   - Persistent disks for MySQL Source and Replica nodes to store database data.
   - Storage for Orchestrator metadata (Cloud SQL).

4. **Autoscaling**:
   - Autoscaling enabled for ProxySQL, MySQL Source, Replica, and Orchestrator instances to handle varying loads.

5. **Redundancy and Fault Tolerance**:
   - Multi-zone deployment for critical components (e.g., ProxySQL, MySQL Source, Orchestrator) to ensure high availability.

6. **Monitoring and Visualization**:
   - Prometheus for monitoring.
   - Grafana for visualization.
