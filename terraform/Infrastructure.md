### Summary of Cloud Infrastructure Requirements

Based on the analysis of the provided files, the project requires a cloud infrastructure that supports a highly available MySQL cluster, monitoring and visualization tools, and redundancy across multiple zones. The infrastructure must ensure fault tolerance, scalability, and efficient load balancing. Below is a detailed breakdown of the required components and their roles.

### Comprehensive Infrastructure Requirements Document

#### **1. Overview**
The infrastructure will be deployed on **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** and will support:
- A highly available MySQL cluster with automatic failover and load balancing.
- Monitoring and visualization tools (Prometheus and Grafana) on dedicated instances.
- Redundancy and fault tolerance across multiple zones within a single region.
- Autoscaling for components to handle varying workloads efficiently.

---

#### **2. Infrastructure Components**

##### **2.1 Networking**
1. **VPC Network**:
   - A dedicated Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) to host all components.
   - Subnets for different zones (e.g., Zone A, Zone B, Zone C) to ensure redundancy.

2. **Internal Load Balancer**:
   - A GCP **Internal Load Balancer** to distribute incoming traffic across multiple ProxySQL instances.
   - Ensures high availability and fault tolerance for database traffic.

3. **Firewall Rules**:
   - Allow traffic between components (e.g., ProxySQL, MySQL instances, Orchestrator).
   - Restrict external access to only authorized IPs for security.

##### **2.2 Compute Resources**
1. **ProxySQL Instances**:
   - Deployed on **Compute Engine** in Zones A and C.
   - Autoscaling enabled to handle varying database traffic.
   - Acts as an intermediary for query routing, load balancing, and failover management.

2. **MySQL Source Instance**:
   - Deployed on **Compute Engine** in Zones A and C.
   - Primary MySQL instance for write operations.
   - Autoscaling enabled for scalability.

3. **MySQL Replica Instance**:
   - Deployed on **Compute Engine** in Zone B.
   - Read-only replica of the Source instance to offload read traffic.
   - Autoscaling enabled for scalability.

4. **Orchestrator Instances**:
   - Deployed on **Compute Engine** in Zone C.
   - Monitors and manages the MySQL replication topology.
   - Autoscaling enabled to ensure high availability.

5. **Dedicated Instances for Monitoring Tools**:
   - **Prometheus** and **Grafana** deployed on separate **Compute Engine** instances.
   - Ensures monitoring and visualization tools do not interfere with database performance.

---

##### **2.3 Storage**
1. **Persistent Disks**:
   - Attached to all Compute Engine instances hosting MySQL (Source and Replica) for data storage.
   - SSDs recommended for high performance.

2. **Cloud SQL**:
   - Used for the Orchestrator Database to store metadata about the MySQL topology.
   - Deployed in Zone C for redundancy.

---

##### **2.4 Replication and High Availability**
1. **MySQL Replication**:
   - Data replication from the Source instance to the Replica instance to ensure data consistency.
   - Configured for automatic failover.

2. **Orchestrator**:
   - Monitors the health of MySQL instances and performs failovers when necessary.
   - Communicates with the Source and Replica instances via heartbeats and commands.

---

##### **2.5 Monitoring and Logging**
1. **Prometheus**:
   - Deployed on a dedicated Compute Engine instance.
   - Monitors the health and performance of the MySQL cluster and other components.

2. **Grafana**:
   - Deployed on a dedicated Compute Engine instance.
   - Provides visualization dashboards for metrics collected by Prometheus.

3. **Cloud Logging and Monitoring**:
   - GCPâ€™s native logging and monitoring tools to track infrastructure performance and issues.

---

##### **2.6 Autoscaling**
1. **ProxySQL Instances**:
   - Autoscaling enabled to handle varying database traffic.

2. **MySQL Instances (Source and Replica)**:
   - Autoscaling enabled to ensure performance under varying workloads.

3. **Orchestrator Instances**:
   - Autoscaling enabled to maintain high availability.

---

##### **2.7 Security**
1. **IAM Roles**:
   - Assign least-privilege roles to all components to ensure secure access.

2. **Encryption**:
   - Enable encryption for data at rest (Persistent Disks, Cloud SQL) and in transit (SSL/TLS).

3. **Firewall Rules**:
   - Restrict access to only necessary ports and IP ranges.

---

#### **3. Deployment Zones**
- **Zone A**: ProxySQL, MySQL Source.
- **Zone B**: MySQL Replica.
- **Zone C**: ProxySQL, Orchestrator, Orchestrator Database (Cloud SQL).

---

#### **4. Summary of GCP Services**
1. **Compute Engine**:
   - For ProxySQL, MySQL Source, MySQL Replica, Orchestrator, Prometheus, and Grafana.

2. **Cloud SQL**:
   - For the Orchestrator Database.

3. **Internal Load Balancer**:
   - For distributing traffic to ProxySQL instances.

4. **Cloud Monitoring and Logging**:
   - For infrastructure monitoring and logging.

5. **VPC Network**:
   - For secure communication between components.

---

### Conclusion
The proposed infrastructure ensures high availability, scalability, and fault tolerance for the MySQL cluster while incorporating dedicated resources for monitoring and visualization. The use of GCP services like Compute Engine, Cloud SQL, and Internal Load Balancer provides a robust and scalable foundation for the application.
