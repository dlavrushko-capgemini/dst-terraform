### Summary of Cloud Infrastructure Requirements for Target Project

Based on the analysis of the Azure Sandbox environment and the target project requirements for Google Cloud Platform (GCP), the following infrastructure components need to be recreated on GCP using Terraform. The goal is to replicate the functionality and capabilities of the Azure Sandbox environment while leveraging equivalent GCP services.

### Comprehensive Infrastructure Requirements Document

#### **1. Networking**
- **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC):**
  - Create two VPCs:
    1. **Shared Services VPC**: For shared infrastructure components like bastion host, firewall, and Active Directory equivalent.
    2. **Application VPC**: For application-specific resources like jump boxes and database servers.
  - **Subnets**:
    - Allocate subnets for different purposes:
      - Application servers
      - Database servers
      - Private endpoints
      - Shared services
  - **VPC Peering**:
    - Establish peering between the Shared Services VPC and Application VPC to enable communication between resources.

- **Firewall Rules**:
  - Configure firewall rules to allow/deny traffic as per security requirements.
  - Enable advanced threat protection using GCP's **Cloud Armor** or **VPC Firewall Rules**.

- **VPN Connectivity**:
  - Implement **Cloud VPN** for point-to-site VPN connectivity.
  - Configure secure internet-facing access using **Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP)** or **Cloud VPN**.

---

#### **2. Compute**
- **Bastion Host**:
  - Deploy a bastion host in the Shared Services VPC for secure RDP/SSH access to virtual machines.
  - Use **Compute Engine** with appropriate machine type and OS.

- **Jump Boxes**:
  - Deploy two jump boxes in the Application VPC:
    1. **Windows Jump Box**:
       - Preinstall tools like Visual Studio Code, Cloud Storage Explorer, and database management tools (e.g., SQL Server Management Studio, MySQL Workbench).
    2. **Linux Jump Box**:
       - Preinstall tools like Terraform, GCP CLI, and other DevOps utilities.

---

#### **3. Storage**
- **Cloud Storage**:
  - Use **Cloud Storage** buckets to replicate Azure Files functionality.
  - Configure buckets with appropriate IAM permissions and lifecycle policies.

---

#### **4. Identity and Access Management**
- **Cloud Identity**:
  - Use **Cloud Identity** or **Google Workspace** to replicate Active Directory Domain Services (ADDS) functionality.
  - Integrate with **Cloud DNS** for private DNS zones and private endpoints.

---

#### **5. Databases**
- **SQL Server on Compute Engine**:
  - Deploy a preconfigured SQL Server instance on a Compute Engine VM.
  - Ensure the VM is domain-joined to the local domain equivalent.

- **Cloud SQL**:
  - Use **Cloud SQL for MySQL** to replicate Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server.
  - Configure private IP and private endpoints for secure access.

---

#### **6. Security**
- **Cloud Armor**:
  - Use **Cloud Armor** for advanced threat protection and DDoS mitigation.

- **IAM Policies**:
  - Define granular IAM roles and permissions for all resources.

- **Cloud Key Management Service (KMS)**:
  - Use **Cloud KMS** to manage encryption keys for sensitive data.

---

#### **7. Monitoring and Logging**
- **Cloud Logging and Monitoring**:
  - Use **Cloud Logging** and **Cloud Monitoring** to replicate the functionality of Azure Log Analytics Workspace.
  - Configure dashboards, alerts, and log sinks for centralized monitoring.

---

#### **8. Automation**
- **Terraform**:
  - Use Terraform to define and deploy all infrastructure components.
  - Ensure compatibility with Terraform version `>= 1.3.0` and Google provider version `~> 4.0`.

- **Cloud Deployment Manager** (Optional):
  - Use **Cloud Deployment Manager** for additional automation if required.

---

#### **9. Resource Organization**
- **Resource Hierarchy**:
  - Organize resources under a single GCP project.
  - Use labels and tags for resource categorization and cost tracking.

- **Service Accounts**:
  - Create service accounts with least privilege access for Terraform and other automation tools.

---

#### **10. Additional Services**
- **Cloud DNS**:
  - Configure private DNS zones for internal name resolution.

- **Cloud NAT**:
  - Use **Cloud NAT** for outbound internet access from private resources.

- **Cloud Storage Transfer**:
  - Use **Storage Transfer Service** for migrating data from Azure Files to GCP Cloud Storage.
