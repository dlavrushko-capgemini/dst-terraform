### Summary of Cloud Infrastructure Requirements for Target Project

Based on the analysis of the provided files and the target project description, the infrastructure requirements for migrating the existing Azure-based data warehousing solution to Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using Terraform are outlined below. The goal is to replicate the functionality of the Azure services using equivalent GCP services while ensuring compatibility with Terraform and the `google` provider.

### Required Infrastructure Components

#### 1. **Data Sources**
   - Equivalent GCP services to handle data ingestion from multiple sources:
     - **Cloud SQL**: For relational databases (SQL Server and Oracle equivalents).
     - **BigQuery**: For structured data storage and analysis.
     - **Cloud Storage**: For staging unstructured or semi-structured data.
     - **Firestore**: Equivalent to Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL data.

#### 2. **Data Lake Storage**
   - **Cloud Storage**: To stage source data before loading into the data warehouse. This will serve as the equivalent of Azure Data Lake Storage.

#### 3. **Data Orchestration**
   - **Cloud Dataflow**: To orchestrate the transformation of staged data into a common structure in BigQuery. This is the equivalent of Azure Data Factory.
   - **BigQuery Data Transfer Service**: For automated data loading and transformation.

#### 4. **Data Warehouse**
   - **BigQuery**: A distributed system for storing and analyzing large datasets, equivalent to Azure Synapse Analytics. BigQuery supports massive parallel processing (MPP) for high-performance analytics.

#### 5. **Semantic Model**
   - **Looker**: Equivalent to Azure Analysis Services for providing a semantic model for data analysis. Looker can enhance system performance during data analysis and integrate seamlessly with BigQuery.

#### 6. **Visualization**
   - **Google Data Studio**: Equivalent to Microsoft Power BI for presenting analyzed data in a user-friendly format.

#### 7. **Authentication and Access Control**
   - **Google Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM)**: Equivalent to Microsoft Entra ID for managing authentication and access control across all GCP services.
