### Summary of Cloud Infrastructure Requirements for Target Project

After analyzing the provided files, the Azure Sandbox environment is designed to implement a comprehensive cloud infrastructure setup within a single Azure subscription. The infrastructure includes virtual networks, subnets, virtual machines, managed database services, storage solutions, and secure connectivity options. The goal is to recreate this infrastructure on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using Terraform, adhering to the target project's requirements and leveraging GCP's service offerings.

### Required Infrastructure Components

Below is a summary of the infrastructure components that need to be recreated on GCP:

#### 1. **Networking**
   - **Virtual Networks (VNets)**: Equivalent to GCP's Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).
     - Shared Services VPC: Contains subnets for bastion host, firewall, and Active Directory Domain Services (ADDS).
     - Application VPC: Contains subnets for application servers, database servers, and private links.
   - **Subnets**: Subnet configurations for isolating resources within the VPCs.
   - **Peering**: VPC peering to enable communication between Shared Services VPC and Application VPC.
   - **Public IP Addresses**: For external access to bastion host and firewall.
   - **Point-to-Site VPN**: Equivalent to GCP's Cloud VPN for secure connectivity.
   - **Virtual WAN Hub**: Equivalent to GCP's Network Connectivity Center for centralized connectivity management.

#### 2. **Compute**
   - **Windows Jump Box VM**: Acts as a developer workstation with preinstalled tools (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Azure Storage Explorer, SQL Server Management Studio, MySQL Workbench).
   - **Linux Jump Box VM**: Functions as a DevOps agent with preinstalled tools (e.g., Azure CLI, PowerShell, Terraform).
   - **SQL Server VM**: Preconfigured SQL Server VM, domain-joined to the local domain.

#### 3. **Storage**
   - **Azure Files Share**: Equivalent to GCP's Filestore for preconfigured file sharing capabilities.
   - **Storage Account**: Equivalent to GCP's Cloud Storage for blob and file storage.

#### 4. **Databases**
   - **Azure SQL Database**: Equivalent to GCP's Cloud SQL for managed SQL database services.
   - **Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server**: Equivalent to GCP's Cloud SQL for MySQL with private endpoints.

#### 5. **Identity and Access Management**
   - **Active Directory Domain Services (ADDS)**: Equivalent to GCP's Managed Service for Microsoft Active Directory for domain services and DNS integration.
   - **Private DNS Zones**: Equivalent to GCP's Cloud DNS for private DNS management.

#### 6. **Security**
   - **Azure Bastion**: Equivalent to GCP's Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP) for secure RDP and SSH connectivity.
   - **Azure Firewall**: Equivalent to GCP's Cloud Firewall for advanced threat protection.
   - **Key Vault**: Equivalent to GCP's Secret Manager for secure storage of sensitive information.

#### 7. **Monitoring and Automation**
   - **Log Analytics Workspace**: Equivalent to GCP's Cloud Logging and Cloud Monitoring for centralized logging and monitoring.
   - **Automation Account**: Equivalent to GCP's Cloud Functions or Cloud Run for automation tasks.

### Comprehensive Infrastructure Requirements Document

#### Project Overview
The target project aims to migrate the Azure Sandbox environment to Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using Terraform. The infrastructure will be designed to replicate the functionality and capabilities of the Azure Sandbox while leveraging GCP's service offerings. The goal is to ensure compatibility, scalability, and adherence to best practices for enterprise-grade applications.

#### Infrastructure Components
1. **Networking**
   - Create two VPCs:
     - `shared-services-vpc`: Contains subnets for bastion host, firewall, and ADDS.
     - `application-vpc`: Contains subnets for application servers, database servers, and private links.
   - Configure subnets within each VPC for resource isolation.
   - Establish VPC peering between `shared-services-vpc` and `application-vpc`.
   - Assign public IP addresses for external access to bastion host and firewall.
   - Implement Cloud VPN for point-to-site connectivity.
   - Use Network Connectivity Center for centralized connectivity management.

2. **Compute**
   - Provision Windows and Linux virtual machines:
     - Windows VM: Preinstall development tools (e.g., Visual Studio Code, SQL Server Management Studio).
     - Linux VM: Preinstall DevOps tools (e.g., Terraform, Azure CLI).
   - Deploy a SQL Server VM, domain-joined to the local domain.

3. **Storage**
   - Create a Filestore instance for file sharing.
   - Use Cloud Storage for blob and file storage.

4. **Databases**
   - Deploy Cloud SQL instances for:
     - SQL Server (managed SQL database services).
     - MySQL (managed MySQL database services with private endpoints).

5. **Identity and Access Management**
   - Configure Managed Service for Microsoft Active Directory for domain services and DNS integration.
   - Set up Cloud DNS for private DNS zones.

6. **Security**
   - Implement Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP) for secure RDP and SSH connectivity.
   - Configure Cloud Firewall for advanced threat protection.
   - Use Secret Manager for secure storage of sensitive information.

7. **Monitoring and Automation**
   - Set up Cloud Logging and Cloud Monitoring for centralized logging and monitoring.
   - Use Cloud Functions or Cloud Run for automation tasks.

#### Implementation Notes
- Use Terraform to define and manage all infrastructure components.
- Enforce version constraints:
  - Terraform version `>= 1.3.0`.
  - Google Cloud provider version `~> 4.0`.
- Ensure modular and extensible configuration for future scalability.
- Follow GCP best practices for security, cost optimization, and governance.

#### Deliverables
- Terraform configuration files defining the GCP infrastructure.
- Documentation outlining the infrastructure setup and deployment process.
- Testing and validation of the migrated infrastructure to ensure functionality and performance.

By adhering to this infrastructure requirements document, the target project will successfully replicate the Azure Sandbox environment on GCP, leveraging Terraform for efficient and automated cloud resource management.
